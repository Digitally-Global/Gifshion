    Exchange Policy: At Gifshion, we understand that sometimes you may need to exchange a product
    due to reasons such as size, colour, or personal preference. We strive to provide a hassle-free
    exchange process to ensure your satisfaction. Please review our exchange policy below:
    Eligibility for Exchange: To be eligible for an exchange, please ensure that the following
    conditions are met: The item must be unused, in its original packaging, and in the same
    condition as when you received it. The exchange request should be initiated within 15 days from
    the date of delivery. Exchange Process: To initiate an exchange, please follow these steps:
    Contact our customer support team or visit our website to initiate the exchange request. Provide
    the necessary details such as your order number, product information, and reason for the
    exchange. Our customer support team will guide you through the necessary steps and provide you
    with an exchange authorization. Once the exchange is authorized, you can return the item to us
    using a reliable shipping method. Upon receiving the returned item and verifying its condition,
    we will process the exchange and ship the replacement item to you. Conditions for Exchange: The
    exchange is subject to product availability. If the requested replacement item is not available,
    we will provide alternatives or issue a refund. In case the exchanged item has a price
    difference from the original item, you may need to pay the additional amount or receive a
    partial refund accordingly. Any shipping charges incurred during the exchange process may not be
    refundable. Exceptions: Please note that certain products may not be eligible for exchange due
    to hygiene or safety reasons. These may include items such as perishable goods like Cakes,
    Flowers and Chocolates. We encourage you to review the product description or contact our
    customer support team for any specific queries regarding exchange eligibility. Our aim is to
    ensure your satisfaction with every purchase from Gifshion. If you have any further questions or
    require assistance regarding our exchange policy, please feel free to reach out to our dedicated
