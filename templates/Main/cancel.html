    will process your refund or credit note whichever is required. *The credit note is used to
    offset the amount against future purchases from Gifshion. For example, if the credit note amount
    is Rs 500, you can deduct this amount from your next purchase or apply it towards any
    outstanding balance you may have with Gifshion. It's important to note that credit notes are
