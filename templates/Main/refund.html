  <h4>Eligibility for Refunds:</h4>
  <br />
  <h4>
    Refunds are available for eligible products that meet the specified criteria outlined in our

    reasons, such as intimate apparel, cosmetics, or perishable goods like cakes or chocolates. We
    encourage you to review the product description or contact our customer support team for any
    specific queries regarding refund eligibility.
