    MIDNIGHT DELIVERY At Gifshion, we understand that special occasions and surprises can arise at
    any time, which is why we offer midnight delivery services for select products. Here's some
    information about our midnight delivery service: Availability: Midnight delivery service is
    available for specific products that are eligible for this service. Not all products may be
    available for midnight delivery due to various factors such as location, product type, and
    delivery feasibility. To check if a product is eligible for midnight delivery, please refer to
    the product description or contact our customer support team for assistance. Ordering Process:
    To avail midnight delivery, place your order on our website or through our customer support team
    well in advance, preferably a day or two before the desired delivery date. During the checkout
    process, you will have the option to select midnight delivery if it is available for your
    location and the chosen product. Please provide accurate delivery information, including the
    recipient's name, address, and contact number, to ensure a successful delivery. Delivery Time:
    Our midnight delivery service aims to deliver the product between the late evening hours and
    midnight, typically between 11:00 PM and 12:00 AM. Please note that exact delivery timings may
    vary based on factors such as location, traffic conditions, and delivery route. While we make
    every effort to deliver within the desired time frame, unforeseen circumstances may cause slight
    delays. Additional Charges: Midnight delivery is a premium service and may involve additional
    charges beyond the standard delivery fee. The exact charges will be communicated to you during
    the checkout process or by our customer support team. The additional charges cover the
    logistical arrangements and extra resources required for ensuring a timely and special delivery
    during the late hours. Precautions: We recommend placing the order well in advance and providing
    accurate delivery information to avoid any delivery complications. It's important to ensure that
    the recipient will be available at the delivery location during the specified time frame to
    receive the order. If the recipient is unavailable, our delivery personnel will make reasonable
    attempts to contact them or leave the order in a safe place if instructed to do so. Please note
    that our midnight delivery service is subject to availability and may have specific terms and
